# ATC_MiThermometer for Azarton

_This repository is a fork of the great work of https://pvvx.github.io/ATC_MiThermometer. I bought accidently the azarton version of the MH0-C401 thermometer before reading https://github.com/pvvx/ATC_MiThermometer/issues/114._

So I started analyzing the Azarton using a cheap logic analyzer and implemented a version to get my thermometers run.

There are the following known issues:

* initial value is shown ~10-12 sec. after startup
* degree sign not show
* battery sign not shown

Thats the reason I do not provide a binary here, or create a merge request.
